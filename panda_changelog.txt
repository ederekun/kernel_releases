# Main Features
- Upstreamed 4.4.280 merged
- Latest CAF tag and wifi stack merged for msm8998
  - LA.UM.8.4.c25-02500-8x98.0 / LA.UM.8.2.r2-04800-sdm660.0
- Built with latest LLVM Clang 12 from LLVM's apt repository for Debian
- Adaptive Tune Structure
  - Dynamically sets values according to interactivity with durations preconfigured, check lazy_defconfig
    in source code to see the values.
  - Can be modified through any kernel manager by changing adaptive_boost value, a parameter part of the
    schedtune structure.
  - Makes use of PM QoS to further suplement and improve overall system performance.
- Sultan's CPU higher efficiency frequency table
- Selected changes to scheduler and ARM64 assembly and locking headers backported from higher kernel versions
- New schedtune parameter - 'boost_bias'
  - This separately enables the bias that comes with boosting tasks. This is equivalent to enabling boost
    which allows the scheduler to just prefer big cluster cpus without increasing the utilization of the
    tasks in the said cgroup.
- Unified wifi drivers for better custom ROM support
- Modified Simple Low Memory Killer by Sultan
- ARM's Power Allocator Thermal Governor
- DTS 24bit HPX Eagle ADM and ASM forwardport with modifications to force functionality
- Sound driver modifications (Hardcoded)
  - Forced CLS_AB RX HPH Mode (except for telephony)
    - Also reconfigured CLS_AB HPH and gain path to match CLS_AB_HIFI implementation
    - Removed low-power configuration (xvlad113x and Yaroslav Furman)
  - 0.8 DAC gain
  - Removed RX HPFs
  - Turned on MSM HiFi control
  - Set custom ASM MSM audio effect values
  - Removed headphone gain control (does not support the modifications due to the
    changing of gain source)
  - Force map 32 channels and set native samplerate and bit width and format for ADM EC ref
    which is involved in post-processing audio for all audio routes
- BBRv1 + FQ_CODEL TCP setup (repicked from xzr)
- TCP adjustments for better internet stability
- CFS modifications to improve task placement
- Rewritten Flicker free (DC Dimming) driver with improvements
- Updated Wireguard to version 1.0.20210606
- Notification LED control by Lord Boeffla
- Fsync Switch by franciscofranco
- USB fast charge mode by engstk and refactored by ederekun
- Uses Firmware MAC address (same as stock OOS MAC address) by prioritizing FW-provided MAC address
  instead of wlan_mac.bin or platform driver
- Selected memory management modifications from tytydraco
- Removed CPU input boost and Devfreq boost
- Disabled Userspace boosting
- Disabled more debugging codes as much as possible
- Fixed code errors / warnings pointed out by compiler
- Includes all other features the base kernel provides (F2FS, Wireguard, etc.)
- and more minor stuff...
